## Overview

FarmSmart is an innovative solution developed during the AgricConnect Summit Hackathon 2025 to tackle Nigeria's critical post-harvest loss (PHL) problem. Our data-driven approach identifies high-risk areas and crops while providing actionable recommendations to farmers and stakeholders.

With annual losses reaching 40% of harvests and costing Nigeria's economy $9 billion, FarmSmart leverages analytics and digital tools to predict, prevent, and reduce these losses - particularly targeting youth engagement in agriculture.

## Key Features

- **Smart Alerts**: Identifies high-loss regions and crops using historical data
- **Logistics Planning**: Optimizes transport and storage decisions
- **Educational Resources**: Teaches best practices for loss prevention
- **Stakeholder Network**: Connects farmers with storage providers

## Dataset Insights

Our analysis of mock agricultural data revealed:

- **51,355.2kg** total post-harvest loss recorded
- **Top loss crops**: Maize (22.6%), Tomatoes (21.97%), Onions (17.37%)
- **High-risk states**: Oyo, Benue, Plateau
- **Primary causes**:
